# discordBot

Project to test my programming skills. The game is based on the social deduction game Secret Hitler (https://www.secrethitler.com/)

Images are excluded and can be easily retrieved from the free print and play document (https://www.secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Print_and_Play.pdf)

The bot was made for an older version of the discord API. It has not been tested to work on the newer API.
